***Learning Objectives***

*Area Plots, and how to create them with Matplotlib
*Histograms, nad how to create them with Matplotlib
*Bar charts, and how to create them with Matplotlib



***Area Plots***

An area plot is used to represent cumulated toatls using numbers or percentages
over time. Commonly used when trying to compare two or more quatitities.

EXAMPLE:

# data wrangling, we want to look at just the top 5 countries and put them in a line plot
#create a list of the years in our data set
years = list(map(str, range(1980, 2014)))

#sort the data frame by total immigrants from each country to canada
df_canada.sort_values(["Total"], ascending = False, axis = 0, inplace = True)


# make a new dataframe that only has the top 5 countries data in it
# the data frame also needs it's axis switched so the countries become columns
# and the years become indices for plotting (indices are plotted on the horizontal axis)

#top 5
df_top5 = df_canada.head()
#switch axis
df_top5 = df_top5[years].transpose()

#import matplotlib for plotting

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# plotting the area plot
df_top5.plot(kind = 'area')
plt.title('Immigration trend of top 5 countries')
plt.ylable('Number of immigrants')
plt.xlabel('years')
plt.show()



***Histograms***

Histogram - a way fo representing the frequency distribution of a variable by
dividing the data set into bins and putting each dataset in it's respective
bin. The bins are then displayed in order as vertical bars.

A range of 34129 divided amongst 10 bins of equal width.
The first bin takes values between 0 and 3413.
175 data points fall into this category.
175 becomes the height of that particular bin.
The same process is repeated for the other bins.

We are intereseted in visualizing the distribution of immigrants to Canada in
the year 2013.
EXAMPLE***

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_canada['2013'].plot(kind = 'hist')
plt.title('Histogram of Immigration from 195 countries in 2013')
plt.ylabel('Number of Countries')
plt.xlabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show
***

the bins are not alighned with the tick marks on the horizontal axis, making
the chart difficult to read

EXAMPLE***
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

count, bin_edges = np.histogram(df_canada['2013'])

df_canada['2013'].plot(kind = 'hist', xticks = bin_edges)
plt.title('Histogram of Immigration from 195 countries in 2013')
plt.ylabel('Number of Countries')
plt.xlabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()
***


***Bar Charts***

A bar chart is commonly used to compare the values of a variable at a given
point in time.

We are interested in visualizing how immigration from Iceland to Canada looked
like from 1980 to 2013

Example***

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

years = list(map(str, range(1980, 2014)))
df_iceland = df_canada.loc['Iceland', years]

df_iceland.plot(kind = 'bar')

plt.title('Icelandic immigrants to canada from 1980 to 2013')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Number of Immigrants')

plt.show()
