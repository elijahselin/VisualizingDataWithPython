Module 4 - Advanced Visualization Tools

***Learning Objectivese***

*Generating advanced visualization tools such as waffle charts and word clouds.
*Seaborn, and how to use it to generate attractive regression plots.



***Waffle Charts***

A waffle chart is a visualization tool that visualizes data in relation to a whole or to highlight progress agains a given threshold.

We are interested in visualizing the contibuiont of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden to the Scandinavian immigration to Canada.

Matplotlib does not have a built in function to create a waffle chart, so we will have to build one by hand in the lab session.



***Word Clouds***

A word cloud is a depition of the importance of different words in a body of text. Bigger and bolder words represent more significance in the text.

Matplotlib does not have a built in function to build word clouds, but there is another python library that can generate word clouds.



***Seaborn and Regression Plots***

Seaborn is based on matplotlib. Built for building statistical graphics.

We are intereseted in creating a scatter plot along with a regression line to highlight trends in data of total immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013.

Example***
import seaborn as sns
ax = sns.regplot(x = 'year', y = 'total', data = df_tot)

#There are additional parameters for personal customization.

ax = sns.regplot(x = 'year', y = 'total', data = df_tot, color = 'green')
#marker = '+'
