Module 3 - Specialized Visualization Tools

***Learning Objectives***

*Pie Charts, and how to create them with Matplotlib.
*Box Plots, and how to create them with Matplotlib.
*Scatter Plots and bubble plots, and how to create them with Matplotlib.



***Pie Charts***

Illustrates proportion.

We are interested in seeing a breakdown of imigration by continent.

EXAMPLE***

#create a dataframe with the total immigrants for each continent
df_continents = df_canada.groupby['Continent', axis = 0].sum()

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_continents["Total"].plot(kind = 'pie')

plt.title("Immigration to Canada by Continent (1980-2013)")
plt.show()
***

There is skepticism about the viability of pie charts as an accurate way to
show proportion. Bar charts are considered to be better at representing and
communicating the data in a consistent way.



***Box Plots***

A boxplot statistically represents the distribution of data through 5 main
domains.
Minimum: the smallest number in the sorted data. (First quartile - 1.5 * the
interquartile range)
First Quartile: 25% of the way through the sorted data.
Median
Third Quartile: 75% of the way through the sorted data.
Maximum: The highest number in the sorted data (Third quartile + 1.5 *
Interquartile range)
Boxplots also show the outliers that lie beyond the upper and lower extremes.

Example***

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_japan = df_canada.loc[["Japan"], years].tranpose()
df_japan.plot(kind = 'box')

plt.title["Box plot of Japanese immigrants from 1980-2013"]
plt.ylabel["Number of Immigrants"]
plt.show()
***



***Scatter Plots***

Displays values pertaining to typically two variables against each other.
Usually it is a dependent variable to be plotted against an independent
variable to determine if any correlation between the two variables exists.

We are interested in plotting a scatter plot of the total annual immigration to
Canada from 1980 to 2013.

Example***

import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_total.plot(
        kind = "scatter",
        x = "year",
        y = "total"
)

plt.title("Total immigrant population to Canada from 1980-2013")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylable("Number of Immigrants")
plt.show()
