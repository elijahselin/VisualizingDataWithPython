Module 5 - Creating Maps and Visualizing Geospatial Data

***Learning Objectives***

*Folium, a data visualization library in Python.
*Creating maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map.
*Creating Choropleth maps with Folium.



***Introduction to Folium***

Folium is a visualization library that was mostly designed for use with visualizing data on maps. This allows for placing markers on a map as well as creating choropleth visualizations.

Creating world maps using Folium:
Example***

world_map = folium.Map()
world_map
***

folium maps are interactive (You can zoom in and out after the maps has rendered)
The default maps type is open street, where the streets are displayed when zoomed in and countries' borders are displayed when zoomed all of the way out.

Let's create a world map centered around Canada.

Example***
world_map = folium.Map(
    location = [56.130, -106.35]
    zoom_start = 4
)
world_map

There are other maps styles that can be used using the "tiles" parameter
"Stamen Toner" is good for visualizing coastal zones and meandering rivers
"Stamen terrain" is good for visualizing hlls and vegetation



***Maps with Markers***

Let's look at how to super impose markers.

Example***
canada_map = folium.Map(
    location = (56.130, -106.35)
    zoom_start = 4
)

ontario = folium.Map.FeatureGroup()

ontario.add_child(
    folium.feature.CircleMaker(
        [51.25, -85.32],
        radius = 5,
        color = 'red',
        fill_color = 'red'
    )
)

canada_map.add_child(ontario)

folium.Marker([51.25, -85.32] ,popup = 'Ontario').add_to(canada_map)

canada_map
***



***Choropleth Maps***

A choropleth map is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed by the map.

In order to make a choropleth map of the world, we would need a Geo JSON file that lists each country along with any geospatial data to define its borders and boundaries.

Let's see how we can create a choropleth map of the world that shows immigration to Canada.

Example***
world_map = folium.Map(
    zoom_start = 1,
    tiles = ""
)

world_geo = rworld_countries.json'

world_map.
